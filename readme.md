This repository is dedicated to all the walkthroughs I will be making as I read Black Hat Python written
by Justin Seitz and Tim Arnold.
I highly encourage you to purchase the book and support the authors. It is truly a great resource.

I have made modifications to the code on a case by case basis as I have a different style to the authors and have implemented changes that I saw fit or
useful to my own education.
